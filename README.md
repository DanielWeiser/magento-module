Magento module
==============

Magento 1.9.x module for interaction with [retailCRM](https://www.retailcrm.pro) through [REST API](https://www.retailcrm.pro/docs/Developers/Index).

Module allows:

* Exchange the orders with retailCRM
* Configure relations between dictionaries of retailCRM and Magento (statuses, payments, delivery types and etc)
* Generate [ICML](https://www.retailcrm.pro/docs/Developers/ICML) (Intaro Markup Language) for catalog loading by retailCRM

ICML

By default ICML file is being generated by module every 4 hours. You can find file in the web root folder with name "retailcrm_{{shop_code}}.xml". For example, http://example.com/retailcrm_default.xml
