Magento module
==============

Magento module for interaction with [RetailCRM](http://www.retailcrm.ru) through [REST API](http://www.retailcrm.ru/docs/Developers/Index).

Module allows:

* Exchange the orders with retailCRM
* Configure relations between dictionaries of RetailCRM and Magento (statuses, payments, delivery types and etc)
* Generate [ICML](http://www.retailcrm.ru/docs/Developers/ICML) (Intaro Markup Language) for catalog loading by RetailCRM

ICML

By default ICML file is being generated by module every 4 hours. You can find file in the web root folder with name "retailcrm_{{shop_code}}.xml". For example, http://retailcrm.ru/retailcrm_default.xml
